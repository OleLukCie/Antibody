**The Declaration of AI Antibody**
---
  When the tentacles of surveillance burrow into every breath in the name of "smart services"—when private conversations are ground into training data to feed AI’s insatiable hunger—we are witnessing a silent metastasis. Not the unruly spread of cells, but the malignant expansion of data power. This is no sci-fi warning; it is the reality unfolding now: every idle chat, every moment of hesitation, every half-formed thought fragment of yours is being forged into a weapon for algorithms to control you. 
<br>
  I named this tool "Antibody" because it has never fought technology itself, but the process by which technology mutates into a "data cancer." When tech giants use the anesthetic of "user experience" to mask the truth of data plunder—when the sugarcoating of "personalized recommendations" hides the greedy heart of privacy theft—we need a mechanism. A way for ordinary people to hand over "visible information" while retaining one last line of defense over their "data sovereignty." Like the human immune system: it doesn’t block normal exchange, but recognizes and eradicates the abnormal cells that threaten to multiply out of control. 
<br>
  AI itself is innocent. Guilty is the arrogance that codes "privacy violation" into a business model. When companies claim "anonymized data is safe to use," yet secretly use algorithms to reconstruct individual identities; when "user consent" is buried in fine print, while no one tells you your chat logs are training AI to mimic your voice, predict your moves—this is not progress. It is a tender trap of technological authoritarianism. What terrifies about cancer is healthy cells turned against the body; what terrifies about data abuse is that the tools we built are now defining us, imprisoning us. 
<br>
  Antibody does not disrupt normal digital interaction—it leaves your daily convenience untouched. It merely embeds "invisible immune agents" into the data stream, making it impossible for AI training systems to weaponize your data against you. This is not destruction, but balance; not a war on technology, but a check against its out of control. 
I know releasing this tool will draw criticism: "Does this hinder AI progress?" But remember: progress that demands the sacrifice of everyone’s privacy is not progress. It is sacrifice. Just as removing a tumor isn’t a rejection of life, but a fight to preserve it, Antibody merely buys breathing room for a "data immune system" in the digital age. 
Our generation is living through a quiet revolution—not of guns and fire, but of code against code: a struggle to define how "technology should serve people." If we acquiesce data being harvested without discrimination, if we surrender the right to set boundaries for algorithms, then tomorrow’s AI will no longer be a tool. It will be a behemoth we fed with our own hands, until it devours us. 
<br>
  Antibody is not an end, but a beginning. It belongs to everyone who refuses to be "data fodder," to everyone who believes "technology must have ethical limits." Today, I hand it over to the world—because privacy is not a privilege of the few, but the bedrock of human civilization. Because fighting data cancer was never a solo battle. It is the shared duty of every soul unwilling to stay silent. 
Remember: when the system tells you "privacy and convenience can’t coexist," that is not truth. It is a lie they want you to believe. A truly technological civilization should let us enjoy convenience *and* say, with pride: "My data. My control."
